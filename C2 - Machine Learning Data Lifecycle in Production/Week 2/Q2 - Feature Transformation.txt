> True


False

Correct
Perfect! Also, this is considered a con, as it can produce slower iterations being less efficient than in the training.

Question 3
What statement is true about TensorFlow Transform?

1 / 1 point

TF Transform Analyzers are run during training and serving time


> TF Transform eliminates the risk of introducing training-serving skew


TF Transform requires specifying preprocessing steps at serving time


In a TFX pipeline, this component is usually placed after TF trainer

Correct
Good call! TF Transform uses the same code path for both training and serving.

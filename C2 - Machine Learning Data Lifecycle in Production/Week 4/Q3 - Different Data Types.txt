Question 1
Visualizing an audio signal in the time domain usually reveals very little information on its spectral content. Which graphical representation displays the amplitude changes for each frequency as a function of time?

1 / 1 point

librosa


Short-Time Fourier Transform.


Feature normalization


> Spectrogram.

Correct
Spot on! Check this page for more information on spectrograms.

Question 2
What would be a striking caveat or shortcoming of interpreting a video just as a series of images? 

1 / 1 point

Hindering classifier accuracy.


Unnecessarily increasing the dimensionality of the dataset.


Considering that all subsequent frames are correlated.


> Losing the semantic context coming from the sequence of events.

Correct
Correct! Videos are time series as well and thus the ordering of events matter a great deal.

Question 3
In the analysis of the weather time series data set you saw that the samples were acquired at a rate of 6 samples per hour. You also know that weather changes typically occur on a much slower time scale. What is a valid sampling strategy to make predictions into the future for this specific case?

1 / 1 point

> Windowing and omitting samples. 


Omitting samples.


Upsampling by interpolation.


Use one sample at a time to make predictions.

Correct
Right on! Taking a finite window of data plus downsampling is the way to go for slow time varying signals.

Question 2
Which of the following statements about labeling techniques is true?

1 / 1 point

> Label propagation is a technique used in semi-supervised algorithms based on the similarity of different data points.


Active Learning doesn’t require the feedback from a ML model to select the next data points to label.


Active Learning shouldn’t be used on imbalanced datasets


Direct Labeling is slow and expensive compared to other labeling techniques

Correct
That’s correct!

Question 3
Weak Supervision is one of the methods used in production ML to label data. Which of the following statements are true about it?

1 / 1 point

> Weak supervision uses heuristics or labelling functions instead of deterministic labels.

Correct
Correct! 


> It uses generative models to determine weights for supervision sources

Correct
That’s right!


Weak Supervision is more expensive than Human Labeling.


Weak supervision allows sampling data intelligently for labeling

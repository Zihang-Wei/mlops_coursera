Question 1
Which factors substantially complicate production machine learning? (Check all that apply)

1 / 1 point

Model Retraining driven by model improvements


Ground truth that changes slowly 


> Model Retraining driven by declining model performance.

Correct
Right choice! 


> Labeling through Weak Supervision

Correct
Nicely done! 

2.
Question 2
Direct Labeling is one of the methods used in production ML to label data. About it we can say that: 

1 / 1 point

> It needs to match prediction results with their corresponding original inference request.

Correct
That’s right! Feature selection identifies features with predictive power.


It can be applied very often in many scenarios


With it, obtained labels don’t adapt quickly to world changes


> It captures strong label signals

Correct
That’s correct!

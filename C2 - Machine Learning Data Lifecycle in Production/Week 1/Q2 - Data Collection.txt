Question 1
In ML, data are first-class citizens?

1 / 1 point

> Yes


No

Correct
Just right! Data are entities that support all operations generally available to other entities.

2.
Question 2
A data pipeline is a series of data processing steps such as:

1 / 1 point

> Data collection

Correct
Way to go! Data collection is the first step in building ML systems.


> Data ingestion

Correct
Right on track! Data ingestion is the process of absorbing data from different sources and transferring it to a target site where it can be deposited and analyzed.


Data Analysis


> Data Preparation

Correct
You’ve got it! Data Preparation consists of data formatting, engineering and feature extraction.

3.
Question 3
Is the Data pipeline vital for the success of the production ML system?

1 / 1 point

> Yes


No

Correct
 Exactly! It consists of the incredibly important steps to the production ML system success.

4.
Question 4
What do you apply to maximize predictive signals in your data?

1 / 1 point

Data coverage


Data formatting


Feature selection


> Feature engineering

Correct
You’ve figured it out! Feature engineering is the process of using domain knowledge to extract features with high levels of predictive signal from raw data.

5.
Question 5
Your training data should reflect the diversity and cultural context of the people who will use it. What can be done to mitigate inherent biases in a given data set?

1 / 1 point

> Collect data from equal proportions from different user groups.


Commit to fairness.


Adapt to continuously changing data


Engineer better features

Correct
Excellent! Balanced sampling from different user groups helps avoid inherent biases.

6.
Question 6
More often than not,  ML systems can fail the users it serves. In this context, what is representational harm?

1 / 1 point

> The amplification or negative reflection of certain groups stereotypes.


Making predictions and decisions that preclude certain groups from accessing resources or opportunities.


Giving skewed outputs more frequently for certain groups of users


Inferring prejudicial links between certain demographic traits and user behaviors.

Correct
Good call! This is a prototypical way an ML system may fail the users it serves.

7.
Question 7
Accurate labels are necessary to properly train supervised models. Many times, human subjects known as raters perform this labeling effort. What are the main categories of human raters? (check all that apply). 

1 / 1 point

> Generalists

Correct
Good choice! Generalists usually come from crowdsourcing sites.


> Subject matter experts

Correct
Nice going!. A classical example is radiologists labeling medical images for automated diagnosis tools.

> Your users

Correct
Right choice! Users can provide labels within your application. A classical example is photo tagging.

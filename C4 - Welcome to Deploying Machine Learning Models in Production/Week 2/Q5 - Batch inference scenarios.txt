Question 1
Which of the following are advantages of batch inference?

1 / 1 point

> You can use complex machine learning models to improve accuracy since there is no constraint on inference time.

Correct
Nice job!


> You donâ€™t need caching strategies so costs decrease.

Correct
Great work!


> You can wait for data retrieval to make predictions since they are not made available in real time.

Correct
Excellent!


You achieve shorter latency of predictions.
